# Actor Types

The Intrace Corpus classifies actors into distinct types to enable precise filtering and analysis. Actor types are used as query parameters to filter results when listing actors.

## Overview

Actor types are used to categorize entities involved in events. The classification system covers:

- **Government and state actors**
- **Military and security forces**
- **Political organizations and parties**
- **Non-state armed groups**
- **Criminal organizations**
- **Civil society and activist groups**
- **Media and press**
- **International organizations**
- **Corporations and businesses**
- **Individuals**

## Using Actor Types in Queries

### List Actors by Type

```python
import requests

# Get all government actors
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.corpus.intrace.ai/v1/actors",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
    params={"actor_type": "state_government"}
)
```

### Discover Available Actor Types

Use the metadata endpoint to see all actor types currently in the corpus:

```python
# Get all actor types with counts
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.corpus.intrace.ai/v1/metadata/actor-types",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"}
)
actor_types = response.json()
```

## Actor Type Definitions

The following actor types are commonly found in the corpus. Use the metadata endpoint above to get the current complete list with counts.

### Individual

- **Individual**: Named individuals (politicians, activists, etc.)
- **Unknown**: Unidentified or unattributed actors

## Actor Hierarchy

Events, particularly conflict events, often involve multiple actors in different hierarchical positions. The Corpus API distinguishes between internal organizational units and external supporting actors:

### Position Types

- **Principal**: Primary actor in the event (mapped to `actor1` in ACLED format)
- **Secondary**: Secondary or opposing actor (mapped to `actor2` in ACLED format)
- **Sub-Principal/Sub-Secondary**: Internal sub-units, factions, or branches within the same organization
- **Supporting Principal/Supporting Secondary**: External actors from different organizations providing support

### Key Distinction: Internal vs External

**Internal Sub-Actors (sub_principal/sub_secondary):**
- Part of the same organization as the main actor
- Examples: military divisions, battalions, regional branches, factions within a group
- Use case: "Nigerian Army" (principal) with "7th Division" and "3rd Battalion" as sub-principal actors

**External Supporting Actors (supporting_principal/supporting_secondary):**
- Separate organizations providing support to the main actor
- Examples: foreign military support, allied groups, coalition partners
- Use case: "Colombian Army" (principal) with "U.S. Special Forces" as supporting_principal providing training

### Examples

**Example 1: Military operation with foreign support**
```
Principal: Nigerian Army
Sub-Principal: 7th Division, 3rd Battalion
Supporting Principal: French Air Force, U.S. Military Advisors

Secondary: Boko Haram
Sub-Secondary: Shekau Faction
Supporting Secondary: null
```

**Example 2: Rebel coalition**
```
Principal: Free Syrian Army
Sub-Principal: Southern Front, Damascus Brigade
Supporting Principal: Turkish Armed Forces

Secondary: Syrian Arab Army
Sub-Secondary: 4th Armored Division, Republican Guard
Supporting Secondary: Russian Aerospace Forces, Hezbollah
```

**Example 3: Inter-cartel violence**
```
Principal: Sinaloa Cartel
Sub-Principal: Los Chapitos Faction
Supporting Principal: null

Secondary: Jalisco New Generation Cartel
Sub-Secondary: Elite Group
Supporting Secondary: null
```

## Filtering Events by Actor Type

The events endpoint does not filter directly by actor type, but you can combine the actors and actor events endpoints to achieve this efficiently:

1. **Find actors of a specific type** (supports multi-value and numeric range filters)
2. **Get events for those actors** (supports full event filter and sort surface)

```python
# Step 1: Find all rebel group actors in a country with event activity
actors_response = requests.get(
    "https://api.corpus.intrace.ai/v1/actors",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
    params=[
        ("actor_type", "rebel_group"),
        ("actor_type", "militia"),
        ("country", "SY"),
        ("event_count_min", "5"),
    ]
)
actors = actors_response.json()["items"]

# Step 2: Get filtered, sorted events for a specific actor
for actor in actors:
    events_response = requests.get(
        f"https://api.corpus.intrace.ai/v1/actors/{actor['id']}/events",
        headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
        params={
            "event_category": "conflict",
            "date_from": "2025-01-01",
            "salience_score_min": "0.5",
            "sort_by": "salience_score",
            "sort_order": "desc",
        }
    )
    events = events_response.json()
```

The `/actors/{id}/events` endpoint accepts the same filter and sort parameters as `/events`, so you can narrow results without client-side filtering.
