# Actor Types

The Intrace Corpus classifies actors into distinct types to enable precise filtering and analysis. Each actor in the system has an `actor_type` field that indicates their classification.

## Overview

Actor types are used to categorize entities involved in events. The classification system covers:

- **Government and state actors**
- **Military and security forces**
- **Political organizations and parties**
- **Non-state armed groups**
- **Criminal organizations**
- **Civil society and activist groups**
- **Media and press**
- **International organizations**
- **Corporations and businesses**
- **Individuals**

## Using Actor Types in Queries

### List Actors by Type

```python
import requests

# Get all government actors
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.intrace.com/v1/corpus/actors",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
    params={"actor_type": "state_government"}
)
```

### Discover Available Actor Types

Use the metadata endpoint to see all actor types currently in the corpus:

```python
# Get all actor types with counts
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.intrace.com/v1/corpus/metadata/actor-types",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"}
)
actor_types = response.json()
```

## Actor Hierarchy

- **Secondary**: Secondary or opposing actor
- **Sub-Principal/Sub-Secondary**: Internal units of the main actors
- **Supporting Principal/Supporting Secondary**: External actors providing support

See the [Event Data Models](/guides/corpus-api/taxonomy/data-models) page for details on actor positions in events.

## Filtering Events by Actor Type

You cannot directly filter events by actor type through the events endpoint, but you can:

1. **Find actors of a specific type**
2. **Get events for those actors**

```python
# Step 1: Find all rebel group actors
actors_response = requests.get(
    "https://api.intrace.com/v1/corpus/actors",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
    params={"actor_type": "rebel_group"}
)
actors = actors_response.json()["items"]

# Step 2: Get events for a specific actor
for actor in actors:
    events_response = requests.get(
        f"https://api.intrace.com/v1/corpus/actors/{actor['id']}/events",
        headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"}
    )
    events = events_response.json()
```
